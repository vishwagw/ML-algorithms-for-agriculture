In thi folder I have build a farming optimizer model using Machine Learning technolgy. 
I have mainly used the python programming language and Jupyter notebook to build the ML model.
Main focusing on this project is to improve productivity of agricultural practices.
With the rapid development of technolgy now we can use advanced algorithms with hugh potential performance to achieve these goals. 

# Programming language : Python-3.12
# application : jupyter notebook
# python libraries : 
1. pandas 
2. numerical python(numpy)
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sci-kit learn

ML algorithm model is mainly a logistic regression model.

# Dataset :
The dataset involves the following features:
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil,
P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil,
K - ration of Potassium content in soil,
Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall, Label 

# End note :
overall, this project can be used by farmers and persons work in agricultural field for making informed decisions on various aspects of agriculture such as sowing time, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.

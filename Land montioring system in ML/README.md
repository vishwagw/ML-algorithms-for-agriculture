This folder contains the ML algorithm for land monitoring using aerial images. 

# intro:
This ML algorithm based system can monitor features such as soil, vegetation, etc. This is a Earth/land surface monitoring system for residental, agricultural, construction purposes. 
Accurate and up-to-data input data sets are needed to make descisions through a decision making process by a ML model. 
we can detect the changes in ecosystem over the time on a specific land surface.
there are now machine learning algorithms, huge volumes of remotely sensed data with improved spatio-temporal resolution, and cloud computing platforms like the Google Earth Engine, which have revolutionized land cover mapping over the years.
The ML algorithm we are using is a Random dorest algorithm and support vector algorithms as classification algorithms.

APIs:
We will use Google Earth API for aerial images for a specific land

ML Algorithms :

1. Random Forest algorithm
2. Support Vector algorithm

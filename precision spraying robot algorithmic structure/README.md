This is a algorithimc structure that can be used ato create a spraying project.
This Spraying robot is to develop a robotic solution for precisely spraying application for different crops using Machine learning and  Deep learning algorithms.
To create the ML algorithm, we are using a Convolutional neural network as the architecture.

The robotic system will use 4 Neural netowork models for the process
1. training NN model for the sprayer system 
2. testing NN model for the spryer system
3. real time data usage NN model for spraying
4. detection and classifting NN model for plant detection for the spraying


All the models have been writing in jupyter notebook and python programming language. 
to create this project and NN models I have used follwing python libraries. 
1. numpy / numerical python
2. pandas
3. openCV
4. tensoflow
5. keras
6. os
7. PIL

under the data folder, I have included some input data files. We can use them to test or train a specific NN Model.

# EndNote: 
This system can be used to control a robotic hardware system with the purpose of efficient and smart agricultural spraying process based on the plant. 
The proposed system will avoid weed and only spray water in to specific plant we need to water.
We also can reverse-engineer the process into only spray chemicals to weeds avoding crop plants.

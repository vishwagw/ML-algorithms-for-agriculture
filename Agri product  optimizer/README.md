# Introduction :
using machine learning to optimize the agricultural production.
Optimization is the the action of making the best or most effective use of a situation or resource.
By using advanced Machine Learning Algorithms Farmers can make more accurate decisions on various aspects of agriculture such as sowing time irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. 

# Requiremtns :
1. Python 3 installed in the computer.
2. Jupyter notebook or VScode s IDE

# Libraries :
pandas 
sci-kit learn
matplotlib
seaborn

# Data :

The dataset involves the following features:
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil,
P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil,
K - ration of Potassium content in soil,
Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall, Label 

# Building the model :
For this project, We are using a Logistic Regression model for the task of crop optimization.

Following are the steps :
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
2. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, 
3. encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.) 4. Feature Selection (identifying important features for the model) 
5. Model Selection (comparing different algorithms and selecting the best one) 
6. Model Evaluation (measuring the performance of the selected model)
